## Spreadsheet

A spreadsheet is a digital document that organizes data into rows and columns, forming cells where data can be stored and manipulated. It is primarily used in contexts where data needs to be structured visually for better analysis, manipulation, and reporting. Spreadsheets are versatile and can handle a variety of information types, including numerical data, text, and formulas. They are commonly used for financial calculations, data analysis, record keeping, and resource planning.

The most widely used spreadsheet software includes Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers. These tools offer functionalities like formula-based calculations, pivot tables, graphing tools, and macros for automating repetitive tasks.

Despite their versatility, spreadsheets have several limitations:

**Scalability** :  They can become slow and cumbersome as the volume of data grows, making them unsuitable for handling very large datasets or real-time data processing.
**Error-Prone**:  Manual data entry and formula setup can lead to errors that are hard to trace and correct.
**Collaboration Issues**: While modern cloud-based solutions like Google Sheets allow for better collaboration, traditional spreadsheets can be difficult to manage and synchronize across multiple users.
**Security** : Basic spreadsheets provide limited security options for sensitive data, lacking advanced access controls and audit trails.
**Data Integrity** : Without strict controls, data in spreadsheets can be easily altered, leading to issues with data consistency and reliability.
